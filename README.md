# Turing Turtle

Turing Turtle is a desktop application developed by the Turing Turtles team to facilitate the management of larger scale projects. The Turing Turtle application makes it possible to store and manage team members, schedule the  project’s tasks and keep track of the project’s risk assessments. The application provides an easy overview of project data through deliberate display of values and matrixes.

## Setting up the Application
In order to set up the application environment, the user has the option to download the corresponding executable (Jar) file, which can be found at the project’s repository on Gitlab, depending on their own operating system. Currently, the  available executable versions provided can be run on Windows, MacOS and Linux 32/64-bit operating systems. 

Alternatively, the user can clone, build and run the application using the latest version that can be found on Gitlab. Since the application uses Maven as a project management tool, that way it is easier to get the needed dependencies.

## The Main Application

### Start Page and Loading a Project
The start page of the Turing Turtle is where you can choose to create a new project, or load an already existing project. In this version of Turing Turtle, it is only allowed to have one stored project at a time. Creating a new project overwrites the old project. The startpage is always accessible throughout the application.
### Creating a New Project
When choosing to create a new project you will be asked to fill out information about your project. Once this is completed and the disclaimer is agreed upon, a project can be created. The ‘Go Back’ button allows for returning to the start page.

### Overview Tab
In the overview tab you can see the schedule of different tasks in the current project. You can refresh the schedule by clicking the button on the right hand side, if tasks have been added.
### Tasks Tab
In the task tab you can create tasks, edit tasks, complete tasks and add members to tasks. You start by either clicking the button on the left to create a task or by choosing a task from the list and then clicking the “View Task” button to get more options for that specific task.
### Team Tab
In the team tab you manage your team members. You can create new team members with unique IDs. You can also choose to view existing team members, edit them and assign team members to tasks. You can choose to view a team member by either searching by ID or clicking on a team member from the left hand-side list. From viewing a team member, you can press one of the several buttons to edit the members.
### Risk Tab
In the risk tab page you can manage your project’s risks. The risks are displayed in a bar chart, and the details can be viewed in a table chart. Risks can be added and removed from the project.
### Management Tab
In the management tab you can view the project's budget and see different calculations about the progress. You can also choose to change the duration of the project and to change the total budget.
### Closing the Application
The application can be closed at any time by pressing the X at the top right corner. Your project will automatically save before the program is terminated.
